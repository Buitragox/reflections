How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped a lot, it is more efficient that doint it manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could do changes to the document without fear of making mistakes and I don't
have to make save files manually, this way I can save time and be more efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing when to commit lets you have a better control of the versions
of your proyect, but it depends to you when to save, so you may forget to commit your
progress sometimes.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when you are coding your files are usually related to each other so you want
to keep track of every file at the same time.    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use to them to see the different commits that were made and the differences
between one commit and another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I break something I can do checkouts to find what is causing the mistake, that way
I can make bigger changes without being scared of wasting a lot of time just to find
a typo.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using it when I have to make bigger proyects, like games.
