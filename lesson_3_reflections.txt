When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When I want to share what I made with others or I'm working with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    	Because someone could make a change that I don't want to have in my code yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A fork is a github copy of a github repo, a clone is a local copy of a github repo,
	and a branch is a label for a top.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    	Because with that you can check the differences between the last pull you made
	and the commits you have made since that.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	I would be sending compressed files to send my proyect to others but it would
	harder to identify which changes were made in the proyect.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
